# LED-Multiplexing
This project uses MAX7219 dot matrix to display characters using Arduino UNO microcontroller.

# AIM:
Using MAX7219 library to generate different rolling LED patterns such as numbers, alphabets, scrolling text, symbols, emojis, etc. Apart from this, we can also display some sensor data like DHT11/DHT22 on this display for temperature and humidity.
